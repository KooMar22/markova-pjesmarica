This is my attempt to create a music player web app with React.

As some would say - Spotify for the poor ðŸ˜Ž.

Users are able to choose one of pre-defined genres and listen to appropriate songs.

The app fetches the songs from Supabase using tanstack react-query.

To use the code:
1. download the repo
2. have NPM
3. type "npm i" in your terminal to install all required packages.
